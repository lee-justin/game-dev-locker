{"name":"Hello-world","tagline":"This is github test repository for learning purposes","body":"# Workshops\r\n\r\nWelcome to our workshops library, where you'll find all the workshops offered by\r\nHack Club. Choose a track to get started!\r\n\r\nEach workshop is around an hour long and walks you through the process of\r\n_building somethingâ„¢_ (like a website, app, or game). Our philosophy is that the\r\nbest way to learn to code is to immediately get your feet wet and build real\r\nthings (instead of starting out learning concepts).\r\n\r\nThe best way to utilize these workshops is to choose a track and then set aside\r\n3-4 hours after each workshop to keep expanding on what you built (for example,\r\nadding multiplayer support to the [Soccer game](soccer/README.md)).\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or run into any trouble, just ask us on the Slack\r\n([click here](../SLACK.md) for instructions on joining the Slack) :smile:.\r\n\r\n## Tracks\r\n\r\n**HTML + CSS + JS** _learn to make basic websites_\r\n\r\n1. [Portfolio](portfolio/README.md) _A simple portfolio website_\r\n2. [Twilio](twilio/README.md) _A website that makes phone\r\n   calls and texts_\r\n\r\n**Games** _make 2D browser games_\r\n\r\n_(We recommend going through the HTML, CSS, and JS track before the games\r\ntrack)_\r\n\r\n1. [Soccer](soccer/README.md) _A simple soccer game_\r\n2. [Dodge](dodge/README.md) _A bullet dodging game_\r\n3. [Maze](maze/README.md) _A \"Scary Maze Game\" clone_\r\n\r\nFor more recommended guidelines on running workshops,\r\n[click here](workshop_details.md#general-workshop-facilitation-guidelines).\r\n\r\n## Errors?\r\n\r\nSee any errors?

We encourage you\r\nto experiment and improve them (we're always hungry for pull requests).\r\n\r\n| Workshop                         | What You Build                             |\r\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\r\n| [Portfolio](portfolio/README.md) | A simple portfolio website                 |\r\n| [Twilio](twilio/README.md)       | A website that makes phone calls and texts |\r\n| [Soccer](soccer/README.md)       | A simple soccer game                       |\r\n| [Dodge](dodge/README.md)         | A bullet dodging game                      |\r\n| [Maze](maze/README.md)           | A \"Scary Maze Game\" clone                  |\r\n\r\n## Community Workshops\r\n\r\nIn addition to the workshops that the Hack Club staff make, anyone is encouraged\r\nto create workshops and submit them to this directory.\r\n\r\n| Workshop                                   | What You Build                                                                | Author                                                                                                                 |\r\n| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| [Ajar.io](ajar/README.md)                  | A clone of Agar.io                                                            | [@Bogidon][Bogidon]                                                                                                    |\r\n| [Cloud9](cloud9/README.md)                 | A fully configured Cloud9 account ready to use for development                | [@Bogidon][Bogidon]                                                                                                    |\r\n| [Cringe 101](cringe_101/README.md)         | Cringe 101 will give you the tools to create the most cringiest website ever. | [@nguyenbrian][nguyenbrian], [@JevinSidhu][JevinSidhu], [@uditdesai][uditdesai], and [@vaibhavyadaram][vaibhavyadaram] |\r\n| [Git and GitHub](git_and_github/README.md) | Introduction to Git and using it with GitHub                                  | [@nguyenbrian][nguyenbrian], [@JevinSidhu][JevinSidhu], [@uditdesai][uditdesai], and [@vaibhavyadaram][vaibhavyadaram] |\r\n| [GitHub Pages](github_pages/README.md)     | Get your website online using GitHub's free hosting service                   | [@sethtrei][sethtrei]                                                                                                  |\r\n\r\n[Bogidon]: https://github.com/Bogidon\r\n[nguyenbrian]: https://github.com/nguyenbrian\r\n[JevinSidhu]: https://github.com/JevinSidhu\r\n[uditdesai]: https://github.com/uditdesai\r\n[vaibhavyadaram]: https://github.com/vaibhavyadaram\r\n[sethtrei]: https://github.com/sethtrei\r\n\r\n## Contributing to the Workshops\r\n\r\nInterested in contributing to our workshops?
